As C provides an introduction to programming ,this workshop attracts first year students in large numbers. The topics are covered in brief and taught with the help of powerpoint presentations and examples by senior students of the club. The learners can clarify their doubts by asking their queries to the student volunteers of IET. Some of the topics covered are operators, loops ,arrays and pointers."></div>
				<div><img class="img-fluid" src="images/workshops/python.png"  alt="Python Image" title="Python Workshop" value="Python has its applications in backend web development, artificial intelligence and scientific computing. Hence is of growing interest among the college students .IET takes the initiative everywhere to provide the students a basic learning curve which further can be developed by the students by constant practice. System setup is provided by IET, related queries are cleared out at the beginning of the workshop. It is a three day workshop covering topics like syntax, control flow, indentations, functions followed by some advanced scripting and advanced cool stuffs that are made easy with python."></div>

				<div><img class="img-fluid" src="images/workshops/git.png" alt="Git Image" title="Git and Gsoc Workshop" value="Git is a version control system and GSoC stands for Google Summer of Code. Git is a very important topic for anyone
        who aims or claims to be a developer. This workshop gives a thorough understanding about Git and also smoothens the 
        pathway to dive into GSoC. The tutors are GSoC qualifiesTill now only 25 or so students from our college have been able to clear GSoC, the number being much much higher in various other premium engineering colleges in India. This workshop aims to kindle that quintessential  spark that is needed in the students at an early stage so that they can work towards this amazing journey from the 
        beginning and excel in it."></div>
				<div><img class="img-fluid" src="images/workshops/webdev.png" alt="Webdev Image" title="WebDev Workshop" value="Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications (or just 'web apps') electronic businesses, and social network services.When we're learning to program we often have to sacrifice learning the exciting and current technologies in favor of the 'beginner friendly' classes. Through this workshop we ensure that any student gets the best of both the worlds,designed for the complete beginner,covering some of the most exciting and relevant topics in the industry like HTML,CSS,Javascript,Jquery,PHP with MYSQL,Basics of Networking and AJAX, with completion of assignment under the guidance of seniors exelling in the field of Web Dev.

				<div><img class="img-fluid" src="images/workshops/android.png" alt="Android Image" title="Android Workshop" value="Android is everywhere. Some of the devices supported include Smart TVs, Smartphones, Tablets, Portable Media Players, Camera, VoIP Phones, Video game player, Car DVD Player, Car Systems, Smartwatches and even Drones. And if you are a CSE undergrad from any college, your friends and family expects that atleast you must have made an android app for your mobile to make things easier. To get you rise upto their expectations, we conduct Android Learning workshop wherein we approach from the basics of Android into building an effective app and uploading it on playstore. The software used is Android Studio, which makes the learning experience lot easier and impactful.

				<div><img class="img-fluid" src="images/workshops/bg/data-structures.png" alt="Data Structure Image" title="Data Structures Workshop" value="Data Structures refer to an orderly arrangement of data. Without a good knowledge of various data structures, it is easy to be constrained to thinking for solutions in terms of the data structures directly provided by the language.We conduct this workshop to strengthen the basics of various data structures used in real world applications and pave the way for algorithmic programming.This workshop cover topics like Queue,Stack,Graphs,Trees,Vectors,Maps and many more STL's used in competitive programming."></div>

				<div><img class="img-fluid" src="images/workshops/flask.png" alt="Flask Image" title="Flask Workshop" value="Flask is a micro web framework written in Python and based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. Extensions are updated far more regularly than the core Flask program.Seeing the popularity of Flask in the real world scenario , IET takes an initiative to familiarize the students with this extensively used framework."></div>
				<div><img class="img-fluid" src="images/workshops/techtalk.png" alt="Tech Talk Image" title="IET TechTalk" value="IET organises frequent tech talks for its members and for those who want to attend it informally. We give opportunities
        to students from our college to come and share about the technologies that they are proficient in and its current scenario in the tech world. There is a Q/A session afterwards where the audience can share their doubts with the rest of the lot and get answers then and there. This activity is aimed to make our students always aware with the current and relevant tech that is in demand and in a way also enhances their confidence and interpersonal and communication skills."></div>
